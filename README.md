## 🧠 How Auto-Tagging Works

Thought Tracker uses a basic NLP pipeline powered by Python dictionaries. Keywords in your entries are mapped to categories and moods. For example:

* "project", "meeting" → Work
* "deadline", "emergency" → Urgent
* "run", "health" → Health
* "learn", "goal" → Personal Growth

If no match is found, the entry is tagged as **General**.
